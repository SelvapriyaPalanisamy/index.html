My hands-on experience with HTML and CSS is too good. The task assigned was to design a static web page using "HTML, and CSS" which I have actually done with the FIGMA tool. Initially, looking at was easy, but it took some time to complete. It is a mixture of learning and executing. I love this whole process which is supremely facinating .
